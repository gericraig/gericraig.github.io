      <p>Hello everyone my name is Geralyn, thought I prefer to go by Geri. I live in beautiful San Francisco with my two dogs and cat. I have been working towards getting a degree in psychology with a focus on drug and alcohol recovery. But have decided on a career change which is why I have signed up for Berkeley Coding Bootcamp in hopes to get a job working in the tech industry. Eventually I would want to go back to school to further my education even more in computers and coding.</p>
      <p>On the days when I'm not studying, I can be found at the gaming table where I am part of a group of friends that meet up to play Dungeons & Dragons. Just this year I have moved over to the Game Master chair and started to run my own home brew game. </p>
