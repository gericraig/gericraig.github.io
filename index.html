            Hello everyone my name is Geralyn, though I prefer to go by Geri.
            I live in beautiful San Francisco with my two dogs and cat. 
            I have been working towards getting a degree in psychology with a focus on drug and alcohol recovery.
            But have decided on a career change which is why I have signed up for Berkeley Coding Bootcamp in hopes to get a job working in the tech industry. 
            Eventually I would want to go back to school to further my education even more in computers and coding.

            On the days when I'm not studying, I can be    found at the gaming table where I am part of a group of friends that meet up to play Dungeons & Dragons. Just this year I have moved over to the Game Master chair and started to run my own home brew game.

            I dont know what to write so here is some song lyrics that have been stuck in my head all day. All our times have come.Here but now they're gone. Seasons don't fear the reaper. Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain, we can be like they are. Come on baby, don't fear the reaper. Baby take my hand, don't fear the reaper.We'll be able to fly, don't fear the reaper. Baby I'm your man
