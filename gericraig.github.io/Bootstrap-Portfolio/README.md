# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Project Title
.Bootstrap-Portfolio

Description
.This assignment was to enhance the portfolio I made previously with a navigation bar and a responsive grid.

Step-by-step bullets
.Had issues with trying to get one of the images to stay in the row. 
.My CSS file from the original portfolio was badly organized so I made individual CSS files for each html document.
.After a bad start that after a few days I realized that the easiest move was to start a new html file from scratch with the Bootleg navigation and grid, instead of trying to convert the original file around the new code.
